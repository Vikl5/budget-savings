## How to deliver

### Important!
> We advise you to be concious about how your work can be assessed. Make it simple to access, run, and review. ðŸ˜Š 

> We can only review work that we can run, so make sure to package dependencies, include instructions, etc.

> If you are able to host your system in any form, please do! ([Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/),
     [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) are some great free hosting alternatives)


### Design/UX
1. Somewhere where your sketch is stored. This can be a link to a Figma-, XD-, or sketch document or a set of pictures.
2. Feel free to supplement with something that explains what you have designed, why you designed it like that and what you might have improved upon if you were to do it differently or had more time. ðŸ•’ These can also be embedded directly into your design document if your design software supports it.
3. [ Send it to challenge@stacc.com ðŸ“¬ ](mailto:challenge@stacc.com)

### Code
1. We prefer to have your work published as a **public git repository**.
2. If you do not want your work to be public then please contact us so that you can share it with your reviewers directly.
3. You need to include an _readme.md_ file that details some basic information about your project.   
[The template can be found here](https://github.com/stacc/stacc-challenge-public/blob/main/readme.md.template)
4. We also strongly suggest that you make an assessment of how your application can be run on other systems.
